    "This notebook demostrates how to load the example Cora dataset into your TigerGraph database. There are many ways to ingest data into a TigerGraph database (see the [official doc](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/data-loading/readme)). Here we will take the command line approach. No python code is needed."

    "1. First you need a running TigerGraph database. See the [docs](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/getting-started/docker) to start a TigerGraph database quickly. [tgcloud.io](https://tgcloud.io/) is not supported by the ML workbench for now, so the database has to be run on a on-prem server.\n",
    "2. SSH into the database server as a database user. If the database is running in a docker container, SSH into the container. \n",
    "3. On the server terminal, download the following files using tools such as `wget`\n",
    "   - Vertices: `wget https://tigergraph-public-data.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cora/nodes.csv`\n",
    "   - Edges: `wget https://tigergraph-public-data.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cora/edges.csv`\n",
    "   - GSQL script for loading data: `wget https://tigergraph-public-data.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cora/ingest.gsql`\n",
    "4. Open the script `ingest.gsql` with any text editor such as `vim` or `emacs`, and modify lines 11 and 12 to point to the two csv files you just downloaded.\n",
    "5. [Optional] If there is already a graph in your database, you might want to back it up, and then drop everything for a fresh start.\n",
    "6. Run the GSQL script: `gsql ingest.gsql`, and wait for it to finish.\n",
    "7. To verify that data ingestion is sucessful, open GraphStudio in your browser at `http://<server_ip>:14240/` and select `Cora` for the graph. You should be able to see\n",
